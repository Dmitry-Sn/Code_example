# Code_example
 Examples of my code on Python.
 Those examples was used in my master's thesis in Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University; Institute of Physics, Nanotechnologies and Telecommunications.
 Master's thesis is devoted study coatings on Lithium Niobate waveguides. A theory of the interaction of modes with Ti and NbN nanostructures was developed. The structure ofa single photon counter based on a waveguide in LiNbO3 is proposed.
